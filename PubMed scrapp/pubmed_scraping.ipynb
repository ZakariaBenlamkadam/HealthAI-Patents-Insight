       "  'abstract': 'Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure-activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein-protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. AI is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci\\'s lasting heritage is today\\'s burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci\\'s sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology-up to and including today\\'s \"omics\". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"The term Artificial Intelligence (AI) was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 during a conference held on this subject. However, the possibility of machines being able to simulate human behavior and actually think was raised earlier by Alan Turing who developed the Turing test in order to differentiate humans from machines. Since then, computational power has grown to the point of instant calculations and the ability evaluate new data, according to previously assessed data, in real time. Today, AI is integrated into our daily lives in many forms, such as personal assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google assistant etc.), automated mass transportation, aviation and computer gaming. More recently, AI has also begun to be incorporated into medicine to improve patient care by speeding up processes and achieving greater accuracy, opening the path to providing better healthcare overall. Radiological images, pathology slides, and patients' electronic medical records (EMR) are being evaluated by machine learning, aiding in the process of diagnosis and treatment of patients and augmenting physicians' capabilities.

This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and the related topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, journals, search engines, print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions about moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status, it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer moral/ethical status are or will be.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence and machine learning are rapidly gaining popularity in every aspect of cardiovascular medicine. This review discusses the past, present, and future of artificial intelligence in education, remote proctoring, credentialing, research, and publication as they pertain to cardiovascular procedures. This review describes the benefits and limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning and the exciting potential of integrating advanced simulation, holography, virtual reality, and extended reality into disease diagnosis and patient care, as well as their roles in cardiovascular research and education. Nonetheless, much of the available data resides in electronic medical records or within industry-sponsored proprietary programs that are not compatible or standardized for current clinical application. Many areas in cardiovascular medicine would benefit from the introduction or increased use of artificial intelligence. Web-based artificial intelligence applications could be used to address unmet needs for education, on-demand procedural proctoring, credentialing, and recredentialing for interventionists and physicians in remote locations. Further progress in artificial intelligence will require further collaboration among computer scientists and researchers in order to identify and correct the most relevant problems and to implement the best data-based approach to achieving this goal. The future success of artificial intelligence in cardiovascular medicine will depend on the degree of collaboration between all pertinent experts in this field. This will undoubtedly be a prolonged, stepwise process.'},\n",

However, with the advent of deep learning, artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly reliable and will be increasingly relied upon. We review the major advances in artificial intelligence for capsule endoscopy in recent publications and briefly review artificial intelligence development for historical understanding. Importantly, recent advancements in artificial intelligence have not yet been incorporated into practice and it is immature to judge the potential of this technology based on current platforms. Remaining regulatory and standardization hurdles are being overcome and artificial intelligence-based clinical applications are likely to proliferate rapidly.'},\n",

       "  'abstract': \"Artificial intelligence (AI) has found its way into every sphere of human life including the field of medicine. Detection of cancer might be AI's most altruistic and convoluted challenge to date in the field of medicine. Embedding AI into various aspects of cancer diagnostics would be of immense use in dealing with the tedious, repetitive, time-consuming job of lesion detection, remove opportunities for human error, and cut costs and time. This would be of great value in cancer screening programs. By using AI algorithms, data from digital images from radiology and pathology that are imperceptible to the human eye can be identified (radiomics and pathomics). Correlating radiomics and pathomics with clinico-demographic-therapy-morbidity-mortality profiles will lead to a greater understanding of cancers. Specific imaging phenotypes have been found to be associated with specific gene-determined molecular pathways involved in cancer pathogenesis (radiogenomics). All these developments would not only help to personalize oncologic practice but also lead to the development of new imaging biomarkers. AI algorithms in oncoimaging and oncopathology will broadly have the following uses: cancer screening (detection of lesions), characterization and grading of tumors, and clinical decision-making and prognostication. However, AI cannot be a foolproof panacea nor can it supplant the role of humans. It can however be a powerful and useful complement to human insights and deeper understanding. Multiple issues like standardization, validity, ethics, privacy, finances, legal liability, training, accreditation, etc., need to be overcome before the vast potential of AI in diagnostic oncology can be fully harnessed.\"},\n",

In recent decades, there has been an expansion of AI applications in biomedical sciences. The possibilities of artificial intelligence in the field of medical diagnostics, risk prediction and support of therapeutic techniques are growing rapidly. The aim of the article is to analyze the current use of AI in nutrients science research. The literature review was conducted in PubMed. A total of 399 records published between 1987 and 2020 were obtained, of which, after analyzing the titles and abstracts, 261 were rejected. In the next stages, the remaining records were analyzed using the full-text versions and, finally, 55 papers were selected. These papers were divided into three areas: AI in biomedical nutrients research (20 studies), AI in clinical nutrients research (22 studies) and AI in nutritional epidemiology (13 studies). It was found that the artificial neural network (ANN) methodology was dominant in the group of research on food composition study and production of nutrients. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms were widely used in studies on the influence of nutrients on the functioning of the human body in health and disease and in studies on the gut microbiota. Deep learning (DL) algorithms prevailed in a group of research works on clinical nutrients intake. The development of dietary systems using AI technology may lead to the creation of a global network that will be able to both actively support and monitor the personalized supply of nutrients.'},\n",
