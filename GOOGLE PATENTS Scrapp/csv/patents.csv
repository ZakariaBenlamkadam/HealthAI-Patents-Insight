US8388530B2,Personalized monitoring and healthcare information management using physiological basis functions,"Analysis of individual's serial changes, also referred to as the physiological, pathophysiological, medical or health dynamics, is the backbone of medical diagnosis, monitoring and patient healthcare management. However, such an analysis is complicated by enormous intra-individual and inter-individual variability. To address this problem, a novel serial-analysis method and system based on the concept of personalized basis functions (PBFs) is disclosed. Due to more accurate reference information provided by the PBFs, individual's changes associated with specific physiological activity or a sequence, transition or combination of activities (for example, a transition from sleep to wakefulness and transition from rest to exercise) can be monitored more accurately. Hence, subtle but clinically important changes can be detected earlier than using other methods. A library of individual's PBFs and their transition probabilities (which can be described by Hidden Markov Models) can completely describe individual's physiological dynamics. The system can be adapted for healthcare information management, diagnosis, medical decision support, treatment and side-effect control. It can also be adapted for guiding health, fitness and wellness training, subject identification and more efficient management of clinical trials.",,2011-01-06,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f5/35/d6/b4738084e37a41/US8388530.pdf,google patents

TW201812646A,"Distributed machine learning system, method of distributed machine learning, and method of generating proxy data","A distributed, online machine learning system is presented. Contemplated systems include many private data servers, each having local private data. Researchers can request that relevant private data servers train implementations of machine learning algorithms on their local private data without requiring de-identification of the private data or without exposing the private data to unauthorized computing systems. The private data servers also generate synthetic or proxy data according to the data distributions of the actual data. The servers then use the proxy data to train proxy models. When the proxy models are sufficiently similar to the trained actual models, the proxy data, proxy model parameters, or other learned knowledge can be transmitted to one or more non-private computing devices. The learned knowledge from many private data servers can then be aggregated into one or more trained global models without exposing private data.",,2018-04-01,https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ea/81/0e/443437a5612f07/TW201812646A.pdf,google patents
