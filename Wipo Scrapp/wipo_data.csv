The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to diagnose and treat cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, is gaining prominence (CRC). Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent cancer in both men and women. It also kills more people than any other type of cancer worldwide. The objective of this paper is to present a thorough picture of how artificial intelligence could be employed in colorectal cancer screening, diagnosis, and therapy. We also discuss the implications of current AI system advancements for medical diagnosis and therapy. Because CRC can be avoided in the majority of cases, it is crucial that screening methods based on artificial intelligence become the norm. Due to computer-aided detection and characterisation technology, adenomas can now be detected more rapidly. In addition, the use of robotic surgery and cutting-edge computer-assisted medication delivery devices has ushered in a new era in the treatment of colorectal cancer. In the meantime, the health care industry is making substantial progress toward ""precision medicine"" or ""personalised medicine.""

By enhancing diagnoses and customising more efficient and cost-effective therapies, it permits earlier intervention. To differentiate between sick and healthy individuals, it is vital to evaluate all of a patient's data, as well as significant aspects of it. As a result, we will gain a better grasp of the mechanisms through which biological markers signal changes in health. Clinical decision-making has always been challenging, owing to the numerous complexities of illness on an individual patient level. However, modern technology has significantly simplified the process of overcoming some of these limits. To accomplish this goal, electronic health records must be used to practise precision medicine, which improves patient outcomes and enables real-time decision-making. By collecting data from several sources, individuals can utilise electronic health records to track the evolution of their ailments. A machine learning system capable of collecting, organising, and analysing clinical data can assist physicians in better classifying patients in order to comprehend and make better decisions in specific situations. While AI may not solve all problems, it can help health care providers achieve their goal of providing real-time, individualised therapy at a lower cost while maintaining quality.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED AUTOMATIC PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF GASTRIC CANCER AND LUNG CANCER USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS,G06K /,J. Vaishnavi,J. Vaishnavi,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE BASED AUTOMATIC PREDICTION AND PREVENTION OF GASTRIC CANCER AND LUNG CANCER USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMSAbstract:In the past decade, AI has contributed to the creation of innovative medical therapies and the enhancement of current ones. According to accumulating evidence, AI could be employed for cancer research and treatment. Stomach cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is an outstanding example of a condition that could serve as a test case for the first medical uses of artificial intelligence. Machine learning and deep learning are two artificial intelligence (AI)-based concepts. Machine learning is the capability to automatically learn data properties without being specifically programmed to do so (ML). It is a discipline of computer science and data science concerned with optimising the performance of computational methods. In cancer research, predictive prognostic models based on machine learning are becoming increasingly prominent. Deep learning (DL) is an area of ""machine learning"" (ML) that focuses on the study of multilayered computing processes. ML demands additional information about the characteristics of the data, whereas DL does not. Hence, DL algorithms are significantly more challenging to define than ML methods, and it may be impossible to do so. This essay examined the application of artificial intelligence to identify, treat, and predict stomach cancer. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were lauded for their unique contributions to their respective fields. With stomach cancer, there is still a great deal of work to be done in the clinic. Using AI to improve the diagnosis of stomach cancer is a good idea, despite the fact that similar endeavours are becoming more popular. The discoveries could have significant future implications for how we combat stomach cancer. The use of visual modalities may improve diagnostic capabilities, and integration, although time-consuming and laborious, may expand treatment options. It could be a useful tool for physicians and other health-care professionals.

A NOVEL HERBAL FORMULATION (OA-F2) FOR USE IN OSTEOARTHRITIS,A61K 36/48,DR. SURESH D. JAGTAP,DR. SURESH D. JAGTAP,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most commonly occurring degenerative diseases amongst the elderly population in the world (Peat et ai, 2001), that reflects the imbalance between destruction and repair mechanism of cartilage tissue, bone, synovium, joint capsule, ligaments, tendons and muscles (Little and Fosang, 2010, Boyan et ah, 2013). OA is considered to be the 4th leading cause of ""years lived with disability"" (World Health Organisation, 2006). It imposes a global burden of around 1 - 2.5% of total gross national products (Xie et al., 2008). The incidence of OA is on rise and is estimated to affect more than 25% of the adult U.S. population by 2030 (Hootman and Helmick, 2006). A number of drugs like analgesics, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are referenced as useful agents in the management of OA but no drug has been able to satisfy both efficacy and safety (Zhang et al., 2008), It is an established fact that current available treatments for OA are associated with several side effects (Huh et al., 2008). Thus, it is imperative to explore traditional systems of medicine for a potential drug that may help to reduce inflammation, protect cartilage damage, offer relief from disease symptoms and restore patient activity levels and improve joint functions.Medicinal herbs have been effectively used for their anti-inflammatory activity, but their exact role has not yet been documented in scientific literature for the management of OA. The prior art studies in our lab have shown the efficacy of such herbs, which have been widely used in traditional medicine to treat arthritis; in which we have tested comparative anti-osteoarthritic potential of Sida cordifolia L., Piper longum L,, Zingiber officinale Rose, Ricinus communis L., Vitex negundo L. and Tribulus terrestris L. using collagenase type II-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA) rat model. On the basis of results obtained, we have developed a new formulation using specific combination of effective herbs to enhance efficacy of formulation synergistically and checked anti-osteoarthritic potential of new formulations using CIOA model. Based on these results we have prioritized one formulation, hereafter referred as OA-F2 showing highest activity. Present work will discuss about anti-osteoarthritic potential of OA-F2 using CIOA model. Arthritis was induced in wistar rats by intra-articular injection of collagenase type II. OA-F2 was given orally for 20 days (135, 270 and 540 mg/kg b. wt). The effects of the treatment in the rats were monitored by physiological parameters like knee diameter, paw volume, paw retraction; blood parameters studied are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release, C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP); radiography and histopathology of knee joint were also studied. Additionally, we have isolated synovium tissue of rats treated with OA-F2 and studied detailed gene expression study proving anti-osteoarthritic potential of OA-F2. OA-F2 has significantly prevented knee swelling compared to arthritic control (CIOA). Both OA-F2 and diclofenac (standard drug, 10 mg/kg), significantly reduced paw volume compared to CIOA. Paw latency also remarkably decreased by OA-F2 compared to CIOA. GAG release in the serum was significantly lowered in OA-F2 treated group compared to diclofenac. Similarly, OA-F2 has markedly reduced levels of CRP and ALP compared to diclofenac. The anterior posterior radiographs of OA-F2 treated group showed a protective effect against OA. Histopathology revealed protection in the structure of the articular cartilage and in chondrocyte pathology as well as reduced clefting. Treatment with OA-F2 has shown chondroid matrix within normal limits. From gene expression pattern, it is observed that OA-F2 has therapeutic effects on an OA rat model by prominent cartilage protection through controlling MMPs levels, and anti-oxidant levels in arthritic synovium and it has no adverse effects. This new formulation possesses excellent anti-osteoarthritic activity and is a potent candidate for further drug development as a treatment for OA.In this application, we report a novel and effective formulation for the treatment of osteoarthritis which is developed from combination oiSida cordifolia L. and Zingiber officinale Rose, named as OA-F2.References:• Boyan B et al., Biol.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLOUD BASED AUTOMATIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO PREDICT BREAST CANCER AT EARLY-STAGE FOR ALL AGES OF WOMEN USING IMAGE PROCESSING AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS,G06K /,Dr. Rabia Musheer,Dr. Rabia Musheer,"Artificial Intelligence and cloud based automatic healthcare system to predict breast cancer at early-stage for all ages of women using Image Processing and Deep Learning Algorithms Abstract: Despite advances in medicine, cancer continues to have far-reaching effects on modern society. Breast cancer has now surpassed both lung and ovarian cancers combined as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Multiple factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and the environment, have been linked to the rising incidence of breast cancer among women of all socioeconomic backgrounds. In order to effectively combat a disease, accurate screening for early diagnosis and treatment is crucial. The numerous applications of artificial intelligence (AI) have ushered in and will continue to herald in a period of profound change in many facets of human existence. People are being advised to take additional precautions against breast cancer, which has become a significant public health concern. Early detection increases the likelihood of survival for patients with breast cancer. If malignancies are correctly identified as benign from the beginning, patients can avoid invasive treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Numerous efforts have been devoted to researching breast cancer. The initial stage in treating cancer should be diagnosing the condition. Machine learning (ML) has supplanted human experts as the method of choice for classifying and forecasting BC trends due to its consistency and accuracy. This is due to the fact that, unlike other techniques, machine learning can extract meaningful information from enormous datasets. This is true not only for prosperous economies, but also for those on the path to prosperity. This illness affects women disproportionately. This problem is one of the primary reasons why women tend to die younger than males. Breast cancer is one of the most difficult diseases to diagnose at an early stage. In addition, there is an imperative need to develop a technology capable of detecting breast cancer in its early stages, as existing methods are inadequate. Approximately 3.4 billion women, out of a total global population of 7 billion, will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lives. Doctors use this method to determine whether or not to conduct a biopsy on a patient. Despite its limitations, it can assist physicians in determining whether or not to conduct surgery. We constructed a separate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and confusion matrix for each patient. This version of the Alcrase dataset contains approximately 16000 datasets and 30 features that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of an algorithm on the Alcrase dataset. This work's primary objective is to examine and evaluate the numerous available machine learning and deep learning algorithms.",https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=CN382774630&_cid=P12-LTRE0S-24981-11
