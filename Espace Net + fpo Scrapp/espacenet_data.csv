The invention provides breast tumor stem cell prognosis characteristic genes (BRD4, RPS24, SERPINA3, SKP1, NTRK3, CD79A, JAK1, NT5E, NDRG1 and CD24) for constructing a breast cancer prognosis model and application of the breast tumor stem cell prognosis characteristic genes in constructing the prognosis model based on breast tumor stem cell related genes. The invention also comprises application of the reagent for detecting the expression quantity of the prognosis characteristic gene of the breast tumor stem cell in preparation of a kit for evaluating prognosis survival of breast cancer. The prognosis of the patient is judged on the basis of the breast tumor stem cell prognosis characteristic genes and a corresponding prediction model (namely, according to the sum of products of expression quantities and coefficients of the 10 breast tumor stem cell prognosis characteristic genes, and clinical characteristics of the patient are combined), and the method has the advantages of efficiently and accurately predicting the prognosis of the breast cancer patient, and has a wide application prospect. Effective guidance suggestions are provided for clinicians to make a treatment decision on the breast cancer patient, invalid treatment is reduced, the treatment cost of the patient is reduced, and clinical development and application of precise treatment are promoted.",https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CN&NR=116656820A&KC=A&FT=D&ND=3&date=20230829&DB=&locale=fr_EP
